                                  uncertainty - Wars, economic crisises,
                                  killing, rape and robbery, it's difficult for
                                  one to lead a calm and peaceful life.
                                  Sometimes, the unnervingness of it all can
                                  lead to disease and complications which harm
                                  our health.</p>
                                <p align="left"> And once get caught up in such
                                  situations, it's hard to improve our health
                                  situation or worse, the disease can progress
                                  or worsen.</p>
                                <p align="left"> But here’s the good news:</p>

                                <p align="left"> But before we go into that, ask
